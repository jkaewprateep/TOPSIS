🧸💬 TOPSIS algorithms is a good starting point for the preferred option and can be applied with a regression algorithm or selection task because it allows us to sort by preference number and give different weights for our options. </br>
🐯💬 Culture-INFO, preferably selection is popular algorithms in many applications, including queue management and selection tasks naming criteria preference is a good way to start and should allow others to understand its meaning because we can utilize the same queue or we need to understand the report as the output from the system. </br>
🦁💬 Selection algorithms can display and explain this is why TOPSIS algorithms and other algorithms in the same patterns are allowed to use for queue management, even a shortcut queue can be explained in TOPSIS algorithms or an application for best selecting a route or select items. </br>

🦭💬 This week he do not given example codes because it is plenty on the Internet and the heart of this games is application now he use TOPSIS to select best model algorithms for trading stocks and application wider in the fields of quality assuarance because we can scores and sort all difference model algorithms into a table with scores. </br>
🐐💬 IF codes required for example I put it though the reference link and it is work in our setting and environment. </br>

👧💬 🎈 This week we will pace further into the selection algorithm and more next week we will continue. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ We are in the scope of development because we are developing code and applications. This project is similar to our progress with tracking and references. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ TOPSIS is a fast algorithm because it updates scores based on input criteria and updates in rows, combined with CPU calculation updates weight with new values input is possible. </br>
🐐💬 They normalized 🐑💬 ➰ That is why they had operated normalized, a similar row happen?</br>
🐐💬 Do you mean it create similar row or they had similar row 🐑💬 ➰ It save power when you do not need to do normalization but build in command normalize is faster because they do not need to perform the similar row.
