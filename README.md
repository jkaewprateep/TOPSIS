🧸💬 TOPSIS algorithms is a good starting point for the preferred option and can be applied with a regression algorithm or selection task because it allows us to sort by preference number and give different weights for our options. </br>
🐯💬 Culture-INFO, preferably selection is popular algorithms in many applications, including queue management and selection tasks naming criteria preference is a good way to start and should allow others to understand its meaning because we can utilize the same queue or we need to understand the report as the output from the system. </br>
