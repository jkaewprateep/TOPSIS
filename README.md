🧸💬 TOPSIS algorithms is a good starting point for the preferred option and can be applied with a regression algorithm or selection task because it allows us to sort by preference number and give different weights for our options. </br>
🐯💬 Culture-INFO, preferably selection is popular algorithms in many applications, including queue management and selection tasks naming criteria preference is a good way to start and should allow others to understand its meaning because we can utilize the same queue or we need to understand the report as the output from the system. </br>
🦁💬 Selection algorithms can display and explain this is why TOPSIS algorithms and other algorithms in the same patterns are allowed to use for queue management, even a shortcut queue can be explained in TOPSIS algorithms or an application for best selecting a route or select items. </br>

🦭💬 This week he do not given example codes because it is plenty on the Internet and the heart of this games is application now he use TOPSIS to select best model algorithms for trading stocks and application wider in the fields of quality assuarance because we can scores and sort all difference model algorithms into a table with scores. </br>
